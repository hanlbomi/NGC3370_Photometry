# NGC3370_Photometry

Calibrated photometry of point sources in the NGC 3370 ACS field.
Deep F555W and F814W images were processed using four distinct methods. 
   
● DOLPHOT with automatic aperture corrections on individual frames (PhotA.dat)
   
● DOLPHOT with manual aperture corrections on individual frames (PhotB.dat)
   
● DAOPHOT with empirical PSFs on stacked frames (PhotC.dat)
   
● DAOPHOT with synthetic PSFs on stacked frames (PhotD.dat)
